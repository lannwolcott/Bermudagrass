The purpose of the project was to find a data set of interest and apply an ANOVA model.  The data used in the course project comes from the Nation Turfgrass Evaluation Programâ€™s website, LINK HERE.  I decided to look at the impacts of soil texture and soil pH on the quality of Bermuda grass.  The factors for soil texture where sandy or clay and the factors for pH where > 7 or < 7.  Since the bermuda grass plots came from different locations with different growing seasons I choose to compare the averaged values for the peak months of the growing, being June, July, and August.  Each site contained 31 plots of bermuda grass and they where maintained with best practices for the region.
